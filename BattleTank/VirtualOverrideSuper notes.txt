Override - keyword that says to go up in heirarchy and override the method in parent class
virtual - keyword that used to declare a parent method so that methods in child class is allowed to override the parent class method
Super - makes sure the superclass is called.

Ad-hoc polymorphism or overloading (in C++) is overloading the parameters and giving different functionality.

Subtype polymorphism or runtime polymorphism uses virtual and override keywords (must need pointers) works depending on the type of arguments passed.
